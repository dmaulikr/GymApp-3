Easy-Moderate-Hard
(1)-(2)-(3)

Things I've Learned:
-Be careful with migrations/changing database!
-You can delete the SQLite file in ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<version number>/Applications/<app key>/Documents
        -Delete all files, .shm and .wal are temporary
-Relationships just point at an instance, sometimes you want both an attribute and a relationships

-Distant Future:
    -Make custom type to replace NSLog to write only when debug mode is on
