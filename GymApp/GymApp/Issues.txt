Immediate:
    
    -Add (-) button to remove cell from exercise list and exercise from db [MODERATE]
    -Add (-) button to remove cell from workout list and workout from db [MODERATE]
        -DON'T THINK EVERYTHING'S BEING DELETED FROM THE DB...

    -Support rearranging order for exercise list
    -Ensure uniqueness for all parts
    -Can't have workouts that aren't being fully created left on the db
        -Must leave those off, perhaps add boolean for whether fully created and sweep away all that haven't been (?)
        -Ideally wouldnt store on db until person submits (or make partial workout class...and sweep away)
    
    -Once these are done, core functionalities of this stage are basically done

Testing:
Test out changing workout names while creating workout

Easy-Moderate-Hard
(1)-(2)-(3)

Things I've Learned:
-Be careful with migrations/changing database!
-You can delete the SQLite file in ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/<version number>/Applications/<app key>/Documents
        -Delete all files, .shm and .wal are temporary
-Relationships just point at an instance, sometimes you want both an attribute and a relationships

-Distant Future:

Stage 1: Setting up workout

Stage 2: In Workout

Stage 3: Design
-deploy beta version at this point

Stage 4: Social/Online

Stage 5: Analytics
